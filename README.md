# Invisible Cloak Effect using OpenCV  

A real-time invisibility cloak effect using color detection and background replacement with OpenCV.  

## 📌 Description  
This project creates an illusion of invisibility by detecting black color in front of a webcam and replacing it with the background. When you wear a black-colored object (like a cloak), it appears transparent as the background shows through.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🎥 Real-time video processing  
- 🔍 Background subtraction using color detection  
- 📷 Webcam integration  
- 🎛️ Adjustable HSV color thresholds
